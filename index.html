							<ul>
								<li style="padding: 10px">
									This is a short-cut of a more systematic regularization procedure, in which one adds a small regulator $\delta$
									to exponents of the internal $\sigma$ lines (accompanied by appropriate powers of $\mu^\delta$)
									[<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01015800">Vasil'ev, Nalimov, 1983</a>].
									The $1/\delta$ pole singulairities are subtracted using
									the wave-function renormalization
									\[\begin{aligned}
									\phi\rightarrow\sqrt{1+\frac{2\gamma_\phi}{\delta}}\,\phi\,,\qquad \sigma\rightarrow\sqrt{1+\frac{2\gamma_\sigma}{\delta}}\,\sigma\,,
									\end{aligned} \]
									where $\gamma_{\phi,\sigma}$ are anomalous dimensions.
								</li>
								<li style="padding: 10px">
									The full propagators then have the form
									\[\begin{aligned}
									\langle \phi(x)\phi(0)\rangle &amp; = \frac{C_\phi(1+A_\phi)\,\mu^{-2\gamma_\phi}}{|x|^{2(\Delta_\phi+\gamma_\phi)}}\,,\\
									\langle \sigma(x)\sigma(0)\rangle &amp; = \frac{C_\sigma(1+A_\sigma)\,\mu^{-2\gamma_\sigma}}{|x|^{2(\Delta_\sigma+\gamma_\sigma)}}\,.
									\end{aligned} \]
									The relative amplitude corrections $A_{\phi,\sigma}$ actually become important in derivation of amplitudes
									of three-point functions (OPE coefficients) [<a href="https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.102.025003">MG, Smolkin, 2019</a>].
